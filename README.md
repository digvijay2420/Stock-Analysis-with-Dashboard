# 📈 Analyzing Historical Stock Data and Building a Dashboard

This project focuses on **analyzing historical stock price data and company revenue** for multiple companies (Tesla, Amazon, AMD, Apple) using **Python, Web Scraping, and Data Visualization**.  
It demonstrates how to extract financial data, clean it, and present insights through an **interactive dashboard**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The stock market is a valuable source of financial insights, but making sense of large datasets requires automation and visualization.  
In this project, we:

- Extracted **historical stock data** using the `yfinance` API.
- Used **web scraping** (`requests` + `BeautifulSoup`) to gather company revenue data.
- Cleaned and transformed the data with `pandas`.
- Built an **interactive dashboard** using `plotly` to compare:
  - **Share Price Trends**  
  - **Quarterly/Annual Revenue**  

This project combines **data engineering, financial data analysis, and visualization** into one workflow.

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
The final dashboard consists of **two main plots**:
1. **Historical Share Price** → Displays stock price trends over time.  
2. **Historical Revenue** → Shows company revenue trends (scraped from financial reports).  

Together, they provide an interactive way to understand the relationship between stock performance and business fundamentals.
